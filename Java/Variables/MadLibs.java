/**
* <h1>Java Variables: Mad Libs</h1>
* In this project, weâ€™ll use Java to write a Mad Libs word 
* game! Mad Libs have short stories with blank spaces that a 
* player can fill in. The result is usually funny (or
* strange).
*
* Mad Libs require:
* <ul>
*   <li>A short story with blank spaces (asking for different types of words).</li>
*   <li> Words from the player to fill in those blanks.</li>
* </ul>
*
* For this project, we have provided the story, but it will
* be up to you to complete the following:
*
* Create all the variables needed for the story.
* Print the story with the variables in the right places.
* <ol>
*   <li>Create all the variables needed for the story.</li>
*   <li>Print the story with the variables in the right places.</li>
* </ol>
